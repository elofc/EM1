# Roblox Stealth Game

This repository contains example Lua scripts for building a stealth game in Roblox. It demonstrates player stealth mechanics, enemy AI, and a basic sound propagation system. The occlusion logic is inspired by the [Wwise ray tracing geometry guide](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/library/edge/?source=SDK&id=raytracing_geometry_guide.html).

## Structure

- `src/` – Lua modules for player noise generation, sound propagation, and NPC detection.
- `docs/` – Additional documentation.

Use the scripts as a starting point for your own project. The `StealthGame` module ties everything together so you can quickly prototype stealth mechanics.
