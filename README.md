# Roblox Stealth Game

This repository contains example Lua scripts for building a simple stealth game in Roblox. It shows how to implement basic stealth mechanics, enemy AI, and sound occlusion logic. The audio occlusion logic references the [Wwise ray tracing geometry guide](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/library/edge/?source=SDK&id=raytracing_geometry_guide.html).

## Structure

- `src/` – Lua scripts to import into Roblox Studio.
- `docs/` – Documentation for integrating the scripts with Wwise.

Use the scripts as a starting point for your own game.
